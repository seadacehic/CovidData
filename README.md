# CovidData

Welcome to my little app.
I have commited an visual studio web application, with basic authentication and the web part and second, the web part separately.

By openin the web application on visual studio, you have to write username and password which I defined in an array.
So you can write these values ( first username, second password ) :
user1 - password1
user2 - password2
user3 - password3
user4 - password5

After successfll login, a page of corona virus will show for our country where you can change the date in the url to change the length of array.

All cells are editable so you can change them If you want to delete one, you can click on button 'Delete'.
At the end of the table data, there are two buttons. By clicking "Export to excel", you will get a excel file of all the data you see. By clicking "Export to json" you will get
data again but in json format.

Enjoy!
